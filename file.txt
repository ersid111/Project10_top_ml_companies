 Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term &#8220;Machine Learning&#8221;. He defined machine learning as &#8211; a &#8220;Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed&#8221;. In a very layman&#8217;s manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data do we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate. &nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Training of students during exams. While preparing for the exams students don&#8217;t actually cram the subject but try to learn it with complete understanding. Before the examination, they feed their machine(brain) with a good amount of high-quality data (questions and answers from different books or teachers&#8217; notes, or online video lectures). Actually, they are training their brain with input as well as output i.e. what kind of approach or logic do they have to solve a different kinds of questions. Each time they solve practice test papers and find the performance (accuracy /score) by comparing answers with the answer key given, Gradually, the performance keeps on increasing, gaining more confidence with the adopted approach. That&#8217;s how actually models are built, train machine with data (both inputs and outputs are given to the model), and when the time comes test on data (with input only) and achieve our model scores by comparing its answer with the actual output which has not been fed while training. Researchers are working with assiduous efforts to improve algorithms, and techniques so that these models perform even much better. <img src=https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ML-vs-Programming.png alt> Basic Difference in ML and Traditional Programming?
&nbsp; What does exactly learning mean for a computer? A computer is said to be learning from Experiences with respect to some class of Tasks if its performance in a given task improves with the Experience.&nbsp;
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E Example: playing checkers. E = the experience of playing many games of checkers T = the task of playing checkers. P = the probability that the program will win the next game In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
